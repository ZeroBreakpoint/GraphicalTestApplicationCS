# GraphicalTestApplicationCS

My simple 2D tank game built in C# using Raylib-cs and custom maths types.  
Demonstrates movement, rotation, track marks, turret aiming, projectile firing, crate interactions and explosion effects.

## Features

- **Custom Maths Library**  
  - `Vector3` for basic vector operations (dot, cross, magnitude, normalisation).  
  - `Matrix3` for 2D transforms (rotation matrices).

- **Tank Controls**  
  - **W/A/S/D**: Move and rotate the tank body.  
  - **Q/E**: Rotate the turret independently.  
  - **Space**: Fire a bullet.

- **Visual Effects**  
  - Fading track marks that display the tankâ€™s recent path.  
  - Randomly spawned crates that explode on impact.  
  - Tiled sand background for an immersive environment.
